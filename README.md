# War in Middle Earth Game Editor

As the name suggests, this software aims to be an editor for the game War in Middle Earth 
by Synergistic Software & Melbourne House, © 1988. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Middle_Earth.

If you are an owner of a copy of the game, you can use its files to go through the various game resources 
(images, map tiles, animations, and texts). You can also view the whole map of Middle Earth as a single image and save it, 
which is actually not possible from the game itself. That’s the viewer part.

Now to the editor part in the Editor. You can edit WIME savegames! 
That’s a way to experiment with the game situation, especially military unit counts, and to cheat a bit.
So you can create an army of 1000 Gandalfs and send them against an enemy fortress 
or to a friendly city you want to stay undefeated.
